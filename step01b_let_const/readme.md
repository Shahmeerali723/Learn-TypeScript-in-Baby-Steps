# let

With let, the variable cakeType is block-scoped, so redeclaring it inside the block creates a new variable with the same name but different scope. The value outside the block remains unaffected.

# const 

With const, the variable cakeType is also block-scoped, but it cannot be re-assigned after its initial declaration.
