# Common Errors steps:

## 1. Syntax Errors:

Syntax errors occur when your code violates the rules of the TypeScript syntax. This could be due to incorrect spelling, missing or misplaced punctuation, or using incorrect keywords.

## 2. Type Errors:

Type errors occur when you use a value of the wrong data type where it's not allowed. TypeScript is strict about data types, so using the wrong type can result in a type error.

## 3. Undefined or Null Errors:

These errors occur when you try to access properties or methods on variables that are null or undefined.


## 4. Scope Errors:

Scope errors occur when you try to access a variable outside of its scope. TypeScript enforces block scope, so variables declared within a block are only accessible within that block.



## 5. Function Errors:

Errors related to functions can include incorrect argument types, missing return statements in functions that are expected to return a value, etc.


## 6. Unused Variables:

TypeScript may give you warnings about variables that you've declared but haven't used. While not an error, this can help you catch potential issues.

## 7. Property Assignment Errors:

Errors can also occur if you try to assign a value to a property that doesn't exist on an object.
