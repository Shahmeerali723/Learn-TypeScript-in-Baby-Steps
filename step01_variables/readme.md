# Variable

Variable means anything that can vary. 
 A TypeScript variable is simply the name of the storage location. 
A variable must have a unique name. 
Variables are values in your code that can represent different values each time the code runs. 
 The first time you create a variable, you declare it. And you need a special word for that: let, var, or const. 
Example: 

        let firstname = "Ali"; 

The commonly used naming conventions used for variables are camel-case.
